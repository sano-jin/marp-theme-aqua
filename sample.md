# How to use

1. Apply `aqua.css`.
   - Change the logo by modifying `logo-url` and `logo-blue-url`.
     ```css
     --logo-url: url(path-to-your-logo.png);
     --logo-blue-url: url(path-to-your-logo.png);
     ```
2. The title page can be created with the `lead` class.
3. Also, we have an another style of the title page with blue background: `blue`.
4. As in the original theme `gradient`, we have a `tinytext` class.
   This might be useful for the References slide.
5. Have fun!
